    <h2>🔮 About Deadline Astrology</h2>
    <h3>Deadline Astrology – Horoscopes With Deadlines</h3>
    <p>
      Most horoscopes tell you what’s happening today. <strong>Deadline Astrology</strong> tells you what’s <em>coming</em>. We deliver transit-based horoscopes to help you stay spiritually ahead of schedule—prepared, not surprised. This is astrology designed for action: where intuition meets timing, and insight comes with a built-in deadline.
    </p>

    <h3>💀 The Origin of “Deadline”</h3>
    <p>
      Before Deadline Astrology became a brand, it was a band name—the very first one created by <strong>Nickolas Kettell</strong>, now known as <strong>Saint Nicky JK</strong>. Sitting in his grandmother’s house on the corner of his childhood street, he wrote the word "Deadline" in red ink on lined loose-leaf paper. The inspiration? Hospital heart monitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick had been hospitalized nine times as a child—one stay ending with him being <em>defibrillated back to life</em>. He awoke in a white room, as if he had just returned from the Moon, with <em>Mary Poppins</em> playing on the hospital TV. He watched them clean chimneys while singing "chim chimeny, chim chim cher-ee." That surreal moment between worlds birthed the name “Deadline.”
    </p>

    <h3>👼 From Atheist to Believer</h3>
    <p>
      Before that experience, Nicky was a firm atheist. Spirituality, the unseen, the paranormal—it all seemed like fantasy. But on <strong>January 13, 2013</strong>, 13 days before his 17th birthday, his mother passed away. As they pulled the plug on her life support, a <strong>white light</strong> filled the hospital room. It gave him a message: <em>“Sing over your guitar.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, he wrote a song that doubled as a <strong>séance ritual</strong>. As he performed it in his Nan’s basement, a sparkling, angelic presence appeared and gently touched his left arm. It was his mother. She had returned to let him know everything would be okay. From that moment, his worldview shattered and reassembled—this time rooted in the spiritual and unseen.
    </p>

    <h3>🌟 The Path of Saint Nicky JK</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since that spiritual awakening, Saint Nicky JK has been on a journey of deep discovery—physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. His path has taken him through studies in <strong>chakras, clairvoyance, yoga, psychic mediumship, telekinesis, astral projection, and remote viewing</strong>. But above all, his purpose has been to connect with others from a heart-centered space—through Spirit, music, and insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he no longer works at the YMCA, he once served as a <strong>wellness coach and personal trainer</strong> there. That experience helped him create the <strong>Moon Phase Fitness Theory</strong>, a holistic approach to fitness aligned with lunar phases.

    <h3>✨ A Journey Through Darkness and Light</h3>
    <p>
      At 18, Nicky went on a <strong>homeless adventure</strong> that became a spiritual pilgrimage. With no money and no plan, miracles unfolded: a ticket booth woman saw his struggle and handed him a ticket, saying only, "Be blessed." That moment and others like it solidified his trust in Spirit—and his mission to be a messenger of hope, truth, and transformation.

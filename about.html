      <h2>🔮 Deadline Astrology - Horoscopes With Deadlines</h2>

    <h3>Be Ready For What's coming - Allow Your Soul to Move in Rhythm With Destiny.</h3>
    <p>
      Most horoscopes tell you what’s happening today. <strong>Deadline Astrology</strong> tells you what’s <em>coming</em>. We deliver transit-based horoscopes to help you stay spiritually ahead of schedule—prepared, not surprised. This is astrology designed for action: where intuition meets timing, and insight comes with a built-in deadline.
    </p>

    <h3>💀 The Origin of “Deadline”</h3>
    <p>
      Before Deadline Astrology became a brand, it was a band name—the very first one created by <strong>Nickolas Kettell</strong>, now known as <strong>Saint Nicky JK</strong>. Sitting in his grandmother’s house on the corner of his childhood street, he wrote the word "Deadline" in red ink on lined loose-leaf paper. The inspiration? Hospital heart monitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick had been hospitalized nine times as a child—one stay ending with him being <em>defibrillated back to life</em>. He awoke in a white room, as if he had just returned from the Moon, with <em>Mary Poppins</em> playing on the hospital TV. He watched them clean chimneys while singing "chim chimeny, chim chim cher-ee." That surreal moment between worlds birthed the name “Deadline.”
    </p>

    <h3>👼 From Atheist to Believer</h3>
    <p>
      Before that experience, Nicky was a firm atheist. Spirituality, the unseen, the paranormal—it all seemed like fantasy. But on <strong>January 13, 2013</strong>, 13 days before his 17th birthday, his mother passed away. As they pulled the plug on her life support, a <strong>white light</strong> filled the hospital room and gave him a message: <em>“Sing over your guitar.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, he wrote a song that doubled as a <strong>séance ritual</strong>. As he performed it in his Nan’s basement, a sparkling, angelic presence appeared and gently touched his left arm. It was his mother. She had returned to let him know everything would be okay.
